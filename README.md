# Patrimoine-JAVA

this is the patrimoine project but with Java this time

## To do

- Read and Analyze the subject and come up with :
    - needed classes
    - their attributes
    - needed methods

## My take on it would be

- Classes :
    - Person [ student, user ,etc... ] (name, listItem, currentPatrimony)
    - Patrimony [listItem, value ( we can put the change here )]
    - Item (with depreciation rate )
    - Item category ( An enum ? )
    - Price (with date and value)
- Methods :
    - GetPatrimony() [ based on date due to depreciation rate]
    - AddItem ( can be money too i guess... )
    - GetCurrentPatrimonyValue
